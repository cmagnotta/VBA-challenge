# VBA-challenge 
In this challenge, I sorted and analyed stock data to determine the volume and change of stock trading. Sadly I was not able to finish before the deadline, but I will attempt to finish at a later date.

If I had been able to get a closing value, I would have divided the closing value/ending value and would have placed that in the appropriate column. Then I would have added a conditional to color cells that were less than 0 red and greater than 0 green. And I would have added ws. to the variables in order to run the code on all of the sheets and then I would have added a nested for loop to deal with any instances where I would be dividing by 0. 

Update: I was able to finish. I am submitting this late, however. It's currently 2:43 pm on Sunday. The solution is in alphabetical_testing2.
